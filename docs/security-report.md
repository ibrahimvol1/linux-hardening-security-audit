Security Report — Linux Hardening & Audit

Date: $(date -I)
Host tested: Ubuntu 24.04 (kernel reported in Lynis outputs)
Auditor: ibrahimvol1

Executive summary

Performed a baseline audit with Lynis, applied kernel and SSH hardening, added Fail2Ban, and installed integrity/malware tools. Hardening increased the Lynis hardening index (before -> after). This repo contains the before/after audits and the configuration applied.

Key findings

SSH was configured with default options (PermitRootLogin yes) — changed to no.

High number of enabled services — reviewed and disabled unneeded services.

No file integrity tool originally — installed AIDE and recommended scheduled checks.

Unattended upgrades were present but should be reviewed for policy.

Actions performed

Baseline Lynis scan saved to lynis-before.txt

Applied sysctl network hardening (configs/sysctl.conf)

Installed & configured Fail2Ban (configs/fail2ban/jail.local)

Hardened sshd_config (see docs/03-ssh-hardening.md)

Installed monitoring tools: AIDE, chkrootkit

Recommendations

Enforce key-based SSH authentication system-wide; disable password auth.

Schedule AIDE runs and store AIDE DB on a secure backup.

Implement centralized logging (rsyslog -> remote collector) for SOC ingestion.

Add automated monthly Lynis scans and store results for trend analysis.

Next steps for SOC-ready project

Create detection playbooks for alerts generated by Fail2Ban and AIDE.

Add a sample ELK/OSSIM stack ingest demo (logs forwarded locally).

Provide an analysis notebook showing how alerts map to TTPs.
